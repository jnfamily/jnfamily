      <h1>Biking Fun</h1>

      <div>
        <p class="lead">
          Biking has been the perfect activity for us, both as individuals and as a family.<br>
          It is inclusive of all ages, from an infant in a bike seat to an elder in a recumbent.<br>
          There are rides for all skill levels, from circling a blacktop to climbing summits.<br>
          No need for dedicated gyms or special courts. Go anywhere your wheels can go.<br>
          Savor the ride in peaceful solitude, or fraternize with droves of cyclists.<br>
          What other activity can match biking's versatility and provide all these benefits?<br>
          Exercise<br>
          Sunshine<br>
          Fresh Air<br>
          Transportation<br>
          Socializing<br>
          Low Cost<br>
          Fun!<br>
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Biking Prep Tips</h2>

      <div>
        <p>
          <b>Disclaimer:</b> OK, we're most definitely not biking experts. We commute to work and do amateur biking for recreational fun with family and friends. All the info we've posted on this site have been gathered from our own biking experiences with family and friends and from what we've gleaned off of other people/sites as being applicable to us. So, take everything with a grain of salt :)
        </p>
        <p>
          So, for biking, technically all you need is some kind of bike (and helmet) to go on a ride. However, we've found that certain additional items and prep work make the ride more enjoyable and smooth, especially when having to take care of kids or biking with a large group. The following pages contains biking tips/info we've gathered over our rides, and also what you should prepare if wanting to join our biking group:<br>

      <h2>Biking with Kids</h2>

      <div>
        <p>
          We've got 3 boys 2.5-3.5 years apart. We used to dump the littlest one into a rear baby bike seat when he got tired of biking his 12-inch balance bike, and we'd tow middle J if he couldn't bike the entire route. Check out <a href="biking-fun/biking-with-kids.html">Biking with Kids</a> for more info on the towing device.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the kids are older. The older 2 can bike the entire route, and the littlest one needs some pushing
          help when going up steeper hills or when tired, and if completely exhausted, we tow him.
        </p>
