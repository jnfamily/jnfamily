    <h2>Itinerary</h2>

    <p>
      The itinerary is not set in stone! It's just a rough idea of the timeframe involved. We can always change things on the fly if we're tired or want to play more :)

    <h2>Meeting Location</h2>

    <p>
      We will be meeting at our house, and then biking to the Los Alamitos Creek Trail entrance off of Via Valiente.
    </p>
    <p>
 
    <hr>

    <h2>Biking Route</h2>
 
    <p>
      The total biking distance from our house to Golfland, MOD Pizza, and back to our house is around 12.7 miles, mostly on Los Alamitos Creek Trail, Lake Almaden Trail, Guadalupe River Trail, and short sections on residential streets or on streets with bike lanes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distance from our house to Via Valiente & Los Alamitos Creek Trail is 1.5 miles, and then it's another 3.9 miles to Golfland (approximately 25 minutes of biking from our house to Golfland). Once on the Los Alamitos Creek Trail, we stay on the trail all the way to Blossom Hill, where we get off the trail and bike to Golfland on Winfield. After Golfland, we bike back onto the trail to cross Blossom Hill, then get off onto Sanchez. From there it's a short distance to the Almaden Ranch Marketplace where MOD Pizza is located.

    <h2>Play at Golfland Emerald Hills</h2>

    <p>
      Golfland Emerald Hills on Blossom Hill has miniature golf, seasonal water slides, and an arcade.  Check out the <a href="https://www.golfland.com/sanjose/">Golfland website</a> for prices and options.  We're thinking to play 18 holes and perhaps arcade, depending on what the boys want.
    </p>
    <p>
      I called Golfland and they told us we can't bring our bikes into the arcade/building, but we can bring our bikes in to where the outdoor tables are as long as the bikes are not on the course and are occupied (being watched).
    </p>

    <h2>Lunch at MOD Pizza</h2>
  
    <p>
      Just a short distance from Golfland, we can bike to MOD Pizza for lunch, where the kids can pick whatever they want to eat, and there are outdoor tables and a bike rack area for the bikes. There are also other restaurants nearby if folks prefer other food that they can order to go and bring back to eat with the rest of the group. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to bring board games, card games, etc., in case the kids want to play a bit while the food digests before biking back :)

    <h2>Optional: Almaden Lake Park</h2>

    <p>
      If there's extra time, another optional destination is hanging out at <a href="https://www.sanjoseca.gov/Home/Components/FacilityDirectory/FacilityDirectory/2801/2028">Almaden Lake Park</a> since the trail passes through it.
