    <h2>Itinerary</h2>

    <p>
      The itinerary is not set in stone! It's just a rough idea of the timeframe involved. We can always change things on the fly if we're tired or want to play more :)

    <h2>Biking Route</h2>
  
    <p>
      This biking route is very flat, and most of it is on a dedicated trail. There's a small section on the street going from Berkeley Marina to the Bay Bridge. The Bay Bridge has a Zuckermann Path for pedestrians and cyclists to travel, and then there's a short climb once you get to Yerba Buena Island. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting from Yerba Buena Island to Treasure Island requires biking on some hilly streets. We didn't really find Treasure Island that appealing, though.

    <h2>Lunch Options</h2>

    <h3>Vista Point at Yerba Buena Island</h3>
    <p>
      The YBI Vista Point is at the end of the Zuckermann Path after crossing the Bay Bridge.There are restrooms, benches, a hydration station, and bike racks. From this Vista Point, you can see beautiful views of the Bay Bridge, San Francisco Bay, and Oakland. There is no food available here, though, so you will need to bring a picnic lunch.
