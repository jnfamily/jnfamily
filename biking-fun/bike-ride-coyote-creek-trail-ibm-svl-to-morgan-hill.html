    <h2>Itinerary</h2>

    <p>
      The itinerary is not set in stone! It's just a rough idea of the timeframe involved. We can always change things on the fly if we're tired or want to play more :)
    </p>

    <h2>Meeting Location</h2>

    <p>
      We will meet inside the IBM Silicon Valley Laboratory (SVL) parking lot. To enter the IBM SVL parking lot, a badge is required. We'll park close to the gate and those of us who are IBMers can badge others in. If you are coming from 101 or Monterey Rd, turn right into the first entrance to the parking lot. If you are coming from McKean, turn left into the second entrance to the parking lot. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the following address and link to navigate via Google Maps:

    <h2>Biking Route</h2>
 
    <p>
      This biking route starts out at IBM Silicon Valley Lab parking lot, then out to Bailey and up the overpass, where there's an entrance to Coyote Creek Trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Coyote Creek Trail, it's a pretty flat and nice relaxing ride. It doesn't have much shade, though. When we biked it in the winter, it was beautiful, sunny yet cool, with nice green grass and bushes. Most likely in the summer it'd be a hot and dry ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coyote Creek Trail ends in Morgan Hill, close to Cochrane. From there, we can bike to various different restaurants for lunch.  Check out the list of restaurants further below.
    </p>
    <p>
      After lunch, if there's time we can do some other optional stops. Check out the list of optional destinations further below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given that there are multiple restaurant options in Morgan Hill and multiple optional destinations, I did not map a round trip route for every single possibility. Instead, I mapped a Google Maps route from the meeting location to Coyote Creek Visitor Center, right before the Coyote Creek Trail ends. After that, use the Google Maps links for the various lunch options or optional destinations in below sections to navigate.
