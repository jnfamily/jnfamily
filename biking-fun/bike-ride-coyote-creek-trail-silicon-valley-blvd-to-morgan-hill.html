    <h2>Itinerary</h2>

    <p>
      <!-- The following paragraph is normally in place, but commented out to start earlier on 4/17 due to time constraints. 
      The itinerary is not set in stone! It's just a rough idea of the timeframe involved. We can always change things on the fly if we're tired or want to play more :)
      -->
      Normally we would start a bit later and possibly visit other optional destinations while in Morgan Hill, but on Sunday 4/17 we need to be back at the car by 2:30pm for Hubby to make it on time to another event afterwards, so we want to start earlier and just eat lunch before biking back.  We plan to hang out at the E's family's house afterwards and let the kids play together while Hubby goes to his event nearby.

    <h2>Biking Route</h2>
 
    <p>
      This biking route starts out at the Coyote Creek Trail Head on Silicon Valley Blvd.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Coyote Creek Trail, it's a pretty flat and nice relaxing ride. It doesn't have much shade, though. When we biked it in the winter, it was beautiful, sunny yet cool, with nice green grass and bushes. Most likely in the summer it'd be a hot and dry ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coyote Creek Trail ends in Morgan Hill, close to Cochrane. From there, we can bike to various different restaurants for lunch.  Check out the list of restaurants further below.
    </p>
    <p>
      After lunch, if there's time we can do some other optional stops. Check out the list of optional destinations further below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given that there are multiple restaurant options in Morgan Hill and multiple optional destinations, I did not map a round trip route for every single possibility. Instead, I mapped a Google Maps route from the meeting location to Coyote Creek Visitor Center, right before the Coyote Creek Trail ends. After that, use the Google Maps links for the various lunch options or optional destinations in below sections to navigate.
