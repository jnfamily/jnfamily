    <h2>Itinerary</h2>

    <p>
      The itinerary is not set in stone! It's just a rough idea of the timeframe involved, especially since we haven't done this itinerary/route before, and we most likely will stop at various points of interest along the route. We will be assessing and changing things on the fly as needed :)
    </p>
    <p>
      Given that this is a holiday Labor Day weekend, and there's a heat wave of 100+ degrees weather in San Jose, we anticipate that Monterey will be very crowded, hence why we'd like to arrive at 9:30am at the latest. It's over an hour drive, so plan accordingly!
    </p>

    <h2>Meeting Location</h2>

    <p>
      We will be meeting at the picnic tables area near San Carlos Beach. Looks like there is a (free?) Public Parking lot at Breakwater Cove Marina. If that lot is full, across the way there is a paid City of Monterey parking lot. If that lot is full, just find street parking nearby and bike to the meeting place at the picnic tables.

    <h2>Biking Route</h2>
    <p>
      The biking route is 25.4 miles round trip, with relatively low total elevation gain of 450 ft. We start out near San Carlos Beach, bike on Monterey Bay Coastal Trail for a bit, then bike onto Ocean View Blvd which runs right along the coast. After that we turn onto 17-Mile Drive and continue following the coastline. Some sections of the roads have bike lanes, some do not. It's a beautiful scenic route with many points of interest along the way to check out. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that if you or your kids are inexperienced or less-experienced riders, you will need to know the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Be able to bike safely on the road without bike lanes, possibly with lots of cars on the road during peak days/times</li>
        <li>Be able to shift gears to go up and down hills (especially for kids)</li>
        <li>Know biking safety and laws (see <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-education-and-safety/special-interest-driver-guides/bicyclists-pedestrians/">CA DMV: Bicyclists & Pedestrians</a>)</li>
        <li>Practice good biking etiquette (keep enough space from pedestrians, call out when passing pedestrians or bikers, ride single-file when appropriate, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Lunch in Pebble Beach</h2>

    <p>
      Pebble Beach area has some fancy dining restaurant options as well as a Pebble Beach Market with deli and snacks:
      <ul>

      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      We plan to either bring our own food or buy sandwiches, snacks, and drinks from the Pebble Beach Market. There are picnic tables near the Pebble Beach Market and the neighboring Pebble Beach Visitor Center.  If the picnic tables are full, we can either lay out mats on the lawn, or if early enough we can perhaps take our food to a nearby beach to eat.

    <h2>Hang Out on the Beach</h2>

    <p>There are multiple beaches along 17-Mile Drive, however, many of them require going down a set of narrow stairs to access the beach area, which we'd like to avoid with bikes and trailers.

    </p>

    <h3>Fanshell Beach</h3>    
    <p>
      It looks like Fanshell Beach does not require stairs to access the beach, and it also has picnic tables and seemingly nice sand. We'll check out the beaches on the way to lunch and make the final determination on which beach is good!
