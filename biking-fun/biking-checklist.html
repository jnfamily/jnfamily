    <h1>Biking Checklist for Each Ride</h1>

    <p>
      Here's a checklist of things to prepare or check the day before going on a ride.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Checklist of Recommended To-Do's and Items</h2>

    <hr>
    
    <h3>Load Bike Route onto Smartphone</h3>

    <h4>MapMyFitness</h4>
    <p>
      If the bike route is in MapMyFitness, send the bike route to the MapMyFitness app on your smartphone:
      <ol>
        <li>Click the desired MapMyFitness bike route link using browser on desktop/laptop (or request Full Desktop site if on a mobile device)</li>
        <li>Click "Send to Phone" button to send the route to the MapMyFitness app on your smartphone via an email</li>
        <li>In the email, click the MapMyFitness link which will open it in the phone's MapMyFitness app</li>
        <li>In the MapMyFitness app, bookmark the route (or click the star in the app) so you can easily find the route again</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h4>Google Maps</h4>
    <p>
      If the bike route is in Google Maps, open the route in Google Maps and use turn-by-turn navigation.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Test New Gear</h3>

    <p>
      Test and install any new equipment or gear ahead of time. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This really sounds like a no-brainer, right?  But kids and work and chores eat up all our time, and this gets shoved to the bottom of the list.  However, there's nothing more frustrating than going on a ride, realizing you don't know how to use your new gear, that you left the manual/instructions at home, and spending half an hour or more trying to figure it out on the trail.  Ya, can you tell that's happened to us before? ;)
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Check Tires</h3>

    <p>
      Check your tires ahead of time!
      <ul>
        <li>If your tires are flat, make sure there are no leaks and replace/patch tube as needed.</li>
        <li>Pump up tires to appropriate pressure.  The tire walls have an indication for appropriate pressure range.</li>
        <li>Refer to <a href="/biking-fun/bike-maintenance.html">Bike Maintenance</a> if you need tips on replacing/patching tube/tire.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Check Brakes</h3>

    <p>
      Check your brakes ahead of time!
      <ul>
        <li>Spin your wheels to make sure the brakes aren't rubbing against the rims, otherwise you'll be huffing and puffing yet going nowhere :)</li>
        <li>Make sure brakes are engaged and working properly.</li>
        <li>Refer to <a href="/biking-fun/bike-maintenance.html">Bike Maintenance</a> if you need tips on adjusting the brakes.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      Gotta protect that brain!

    <hr>

    <h3>Pack Bike Lock & Key</h3>

    <p>
      Pack or install your bike lock.  Be sure to bring the key as well ;)  
    </p>
    <p>
      Ya, we forgot the key once.  Well, more like we thought we had it, haha.
    </p>

    <h3>Pack Spare Tube</h3>

    <p>
      Even with tire liners, you might still get flats.  Bring a spare tube just in case.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Pack Water</h3>

    <p>
      Prepare water, either in water bottle to put in bike cage or in hydration pack. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We normally stop at a restaurant or park where we can refill water bottles, in which case you can pack less water.
    </p>

    <h3>Charge Cell Phone</h3>

    <p>
      Charge your cell phone. If you have an external battery, charge and bring it.
