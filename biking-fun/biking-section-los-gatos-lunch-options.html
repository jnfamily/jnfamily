<h2>Lunch Options in Los Gatos</h2>

<p>
  There are many good restaurants in this area. With a small group, we can eat a restaurant with outdoor seating. With a larger group, however, it's easier to bring our own food or order food to go from the various nearby restaurants to eat at Los Gatos Town Plaza Park.

  Lunch couldn't possibly be complete without some sweets! In fact, this is the alluring bribe for getting our kids to bike this route, LOL.
