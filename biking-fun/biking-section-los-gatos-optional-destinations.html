<h2>Hang Out at Los Gatos Town Plaza Park</h2>
  
<p>
  This park is rather small, but it has a lawn area, a water fountain, some trees, benches, and ledges to sit on. It also borders the street Montebello Way, which is used to host Farmers' Market on Sundays. We usually bring mats, portable table, frisbee, board/card games, etc.
