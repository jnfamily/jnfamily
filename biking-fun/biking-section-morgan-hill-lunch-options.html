      <td>MOD Pizza is one of the boys' favorite restaurants, because they can each order whatever ingredients they want on their mini pizzas.  There are plenty of outdoor tables and enough room to park our bikes in the seating area.  This is also a better choice than other restaurants in this list if there are young kids where it's a concern to bike on busy roads or downtown, because Cochrane is quite a busy big street to be biking on. MOD Pizza is in the Cochrane Commons plaza before the Highway 101 entrance, so we can avoid the busier section of Cochrane and avoid biking busy downtown streets.</td>
