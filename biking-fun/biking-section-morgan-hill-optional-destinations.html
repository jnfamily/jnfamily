<h2>Optional Destinations in Morgan Hill</h2>

There are various optional destinations we can visit or hang out at either along the Coyote Creek Trail or in Morgan Hill.

<h3>Aircraft Skypark</h3>
<p>
  The Santa Clara County Model Aircraft Skypark is a place where people can go to fly their remote-controlled model aircraft. It's an open area located next to Coyote Creek Trail with tables, benches, restrooms, and a runway for people to fly their RC aircraft. Normally on Sundays, there's a large crowd of folks who bring their RC planes to fly. The kids have a fun time watching the planes, and they've also had plenty fun driving DK's RC cars there.

<h3>Coyote Creek Visitor Center at Anderson Lake</h3>
<p>
  The Coyote Creek Visitor Center is right next to the Coyote Creek Trail, right before the trail ends. There are restrooms, picnic tables/benches, and water fountains there. There is also a small exhibit that we can check out during open hours.  We typically take a short break here on the way to lunch.

<h3>El Toro Elementary School / Health Science Academy</h3>
<p>
  This school is nearby the various restaurants that we eat lunch at. There's a school playground for the kids to play, and adults can hang out and chat.

<p>
  We haven't actually visited this place yet, so one of these rides we will check it out.

<h3>Anderson Lake Dam</h3>
<p>
    We can bike up a steep short climb to Anderson Lake Dam, where there's a nice view of Anderson Lake. Unfortunately, there's no shade up here, so we probably will just take pics and then leave.
